- Each exercise should be in a different commit.
- If you want to make changes after your commit, you should create a new commit.

## Exercise 1

Write an algorithm and draw a flowchart to convert the length in feet to centimeters.

Pseudocode:

- Input length in feet (LFT)
- Calculate the length in cm (LCM) by multiplying LFT by 30
- Print length in cm (LCM)

### _Answer_
- 1.- Start 
- 2.- Input LFT
- 3.- LCM = LFT * 30 
- 4.- Print LCM 
- 5.- End 


## Exercise 2

Write an algorithm and draw a flowchart that will read the two sides of a rectangle and calculate its area.

Pseudocode:

- Input the width (W) and the length (L) of a rectangle
- Calculate the area (A) by multiplying W by L
- Print A

### _Answer_
- 1.- Start
- 2.- Input W
- 3.- Input L
- 4.- A = W * L 
- 5.- Print A 
- 6.- End


## Exercise 3

Write an algorithm and draw a flowchart that will read three numbers and prints the value of the largest number.

> Given that the three numbers are not equal to each other)

### _Answer_
- 1.- Start
- 2.- Input A, B, C
- 3.- If A > B and A > C is true
- 4.- Print A 
- 5.- If A > C is false
- 6.- Print C
- 5.- If A > B is false and B > C is true 
- 6.- Print B
- 7.- If B > C is false 
- 8.- Print C
- 9.- End 

## Exercise 4

Write an algorithm and draw a flowchart to check the three number inputs whether a triangle is possible or not.

### _Answer_
- 1.- Start 
- 2.- Input A, B, C
- 3.- If A + B > C is true
- 4.- Print "Possible"
- 5.- If A + B > C is false
- 6.- Print "Not Possible"
- 7.- If A + C > B is true 
- 8.- Print "Possible" 
- 9.- If A + C > B is false 
- 10.- Print "Not Possible" 
- 11.- If B + C > A is true 
- 12.- Print "Possible"
- 13.- If B + C > A is false 
- 14.- Print "Not Possible"
- 15.- End 


## Exercise 5

Draw the flowchart for the following:

Accept the name and marks obtained by a student in Computer Project.

Display the grades as per the table given below:

| Marks obtained                | Grade    |
| ----------------------------- | -------- |
| 80% or more                   | A        |
| 60% or more but less than 80% | B        |
| 40% or more but less than 60% | C        |
| Less than 40%                 | No Grade |

### _Answer_
- 1.- Start 
- 2.- Input Grade
- 3.- If Grade >= 80% is true 
- 4.- Print Grade = A
- 5.- If Grade >= 60% and <80% is true
- 6.- Print Grade = B
- 7.- If Grade >= 40% and <60% is true 
- 8.- Print Grade = C
- 9.- If Grade <40% is true 
- 10.- Print Grade = No Grade
- 11.- End
